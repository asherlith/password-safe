# password-safe
A safe for all users' passwords.
This is a password vault, your master password is the password with which you login. Your passwords are safely stored in the database and are encoded using a key derived from your master password( which only you know).
I got help from this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12904560/safely-storing-encrypted-credentials-in-django
Any improvement to this project would make me glad.
